      In warm ocean waters around the world, you may see a strange sight: A fish
      leaping from the water and soaring dozens of meters before returning to
      the ocean's depths. Early Mediterranean sailors thought these flying fish
      returned to the shore at night to sleep, and therefore called this family
      of marine fish Exocoetidae.
